# ArgChain Core
Social Decentralized Argumentation Models (SDAM)

### Description
We find that argumentation in today's world is extremely inefficient and incomplete. A good starting point to solve this problem is the science around critical thinking and argumentation models. (see pic1)

One of the so far most interesting tools to create argumentation models is the project #ArgDown (www.argdown.org). It focusses on creating argumentation models with a simple markup language based on #Markdown.

The next step of evolution would be a social media like structure with a decentralized storage of such argumentation models which allows sharing, forking, merging such models as successfully demonstrated with git via state of the art decentralized IPFS storage.

### Current questions
- could a blockchain help to ensure a proof-of-existence or
- storage of even bigger data structures. 
- could an incentivise model help to create better argumentation models
- how to prevent the danger of the creation of only well financed argument models
- where does the coin receives it value

### Next Steps
- Website
- Social Media
- Funding (e.g. https://interchain.io/)

### Advisors
- general advisors 
- blockchain focussed advisors 
- argumentation / critical thinking focussed advisors
